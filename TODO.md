# TODO

## Documentation structure

* Where should we store deprecated documentation? Should we include it at all?
* Should we rename `develop.md` (`core/develop.md` vs `extension/develop.md`?)

## Extension questions

* How do I include Composer libraries in my CiviCRM extension?
* Should I add the `vendor/` directory to Git?
* How do I release my extension?
* How do I provide downloadable .zip files from Github (which are working builds)?
