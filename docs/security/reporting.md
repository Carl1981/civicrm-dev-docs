# Reporting a Security Vulnerability

## Introduction

CiviCRM Core team and the CiviCRM Security Team are responsible for fixing reported security issues within supported CiviCRM versions. Security released will only be made for those versions with active CiviCRM support. Security Advisories will be made avaliable at the same time as the release of the fix version.

## Supported Release Versions

As of August 2017, CiviCRM maintains two supported CiviCRM Versions 4.7.x series and the 4.6.x series. 4.6.x is in Long Term Support with new features and more active development going into the 4.7.x series.

## Release Timing. 

CiviCRM maintains two Security release windows, they are the first and third Wednesday of every month US/PDT Timezone. Having a release window doesn't mean that a release will occur but it does allow for site administrators to be concious of when there may be a security update.

## Reporting a Security bug

CiviCRM maitnains an email address `security@civicrm.org` which is at present the primary mechanism for reporting security issues. When you do report an issue please include all possible information that would help the Security Team replicate and help solve the issue. You will be credited with reporting the issue unless you request anonymity and also for any part you take in its resolution.

## Security Policy

CiviCRM Has a publicly avaliable policy which details these points and goes into some further detail around our Security practices. The policy is avaliable on the [CiviCRM Website](https://civicrm.org/security).
