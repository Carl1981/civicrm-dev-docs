### QUnit

CiviCRM has a small set up of QUnit which is an automated testing system.  It's generally inspired by the xUnit family (JUnit, PHPUnit, etc) and
allows you to test low- and mid-level component functionality.  It's most suitable for testing pure Javascript components.  For a general
introduction, see the [README](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/blob/master/tests/qunit/README.txt) and [example
test](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/tree/master/tests/qunit/example) that ship with CiviCRM.  It is currently only run manually through a
web broweser.
