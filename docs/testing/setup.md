The easiest way to get set up to run the automated tests is to use [buildkit](/tools/buildkit.md) which will install the tools necessary for running the tests and creating local CiviCRM sites with [civibuild](/tools/civibuild.md).

!!! info
    When writing new tests or making any changes make sure you run [civilint](/tools/civilint.md)
    to ensure your changes match our coding style.

!!! tip
    If you are using PhpStorm, you can [run the tests from within PhpStorm](/tools/phpstorm.md#testing) (which is especially helpful because you can set breakpoints and inspect variables while the tests run).
